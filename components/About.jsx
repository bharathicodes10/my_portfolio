          <p className='py-2 text-black-600'>
            I specialize in building full stack application using latest technologies. Iâ€™m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Since I am a quick learner, I can pick up new 
            tech stacks as needed. I believe that adaptability, the ability to learn quickly and choosing the right
            approach to solve a problem are some of the essential skills of a developer.  I also believe that being 
            a great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>
